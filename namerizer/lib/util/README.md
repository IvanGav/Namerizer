# Util

This folder is intended for all code that is not platform specific 
(such as firebase) and can be used for both android and web

# CloudStorage Class

It's a mess, just look at the comments. Basically, it has
a bunch of methods that are useful for the program and are
relatively independent of implementation.

# Firebase

The root contains:
- collection **classes**
- collection **profiles**

**classes** contains classes, by classCode.

**classes/\<classCode\>/** contains:
- String **class_name** -> name of that class
- String **prof_name** -> name of a professor who owns this class
- collection **students**

**classes/\<classCode\>/students/** contains all
students in that class, with autogenerated document name.

A student contains:
- String **first_name**
- String **last_name**
- String **picture**, which contains url of picture
- String **gender**, which is either: "male", "female" or "nonbinary"

**profiles** contains professor profiles, by **uid**.

professor profile contains:
- String **name** -> full name of a professor
- String **email**
- String **password** -> probably shouldn't be stored, but I don't care lol
- Array<String> **classes** -> list of class code that this professor owns
