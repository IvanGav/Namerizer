# Util

This folder is intended for all code that is not platform specific 
(such as firebase) and can be used for both android and web

# CloudStorage Class

It's a mess, just look at the comments. Basically, it has
a bunch of methods that are useful for the program and are
relatively indipendent of implementation.

# Firebase

The root contains:
- collection **storage**
- collection **profiles**

**storage** contains professors, by UID.

**storage/\<professorUID\>/** contains a collection of **classes**, by class code.

**storage/\<professorUID\>/classes/\<classCode\>/** contains:
- String **class_name** -> name of that class
- collection **students**

**storage/\<professorUID\>/classes/\<classCode\>/students/** contains all
students in that class, with autogenerated document name.

A student contains:
- String **first_name**
- String **last_name**
- String **picture**, which contains url of picture
- String **gender**, which is either: "male", "female" or "nonbinary"

**profiles** contains professor profiles.

professor profile contains:
- String **name**
- String **email**
- String **password**
- String **uid**

It's **NOT** secure, but it is the system until we have time to change it.
