# Main

main.dart contains the main function which compiles different code
according to the platform to which it's being compiled.

# Firebase Options

firebase_options.dart should go to this directory.
Since it contains credentials, it's not being uploaded to git.
As a note, there is another file,
namerizer/android/app/google-services.json, which contain
some sort of firebase credentials.
